## Overview

The goal of this project was to display a responsive coming soon page.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
    -   The `input` field is empty
    -   The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

-   Mobile first
-   Using mostly Flexbox
-   Using Media Queries for the responsive part

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I'm learning to make responsive websites, by media queries.
-   I learned how to declare variables in CSS, and use them.
-   I'm impressed by the power of regex, I project to lean on this later.

### Useful resources

-   [Client side form Validation from Florin Pop on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw) - I couldn't take care of the email validation without this video.
